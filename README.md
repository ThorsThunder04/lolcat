# lolcat
Same functionality as the unix command `cat`, but prettiiier. **AKA** RAINBOOOWO EVERYWHERRREE YIPPEEE!!!!

# Utilisation
It works just like how you would do `cat {filename}` in the terminal to display all of the contents of a given file. Here you do `./lolcat [filename]` to display all the contents.

Note that if you put lolcat in your system path, you won't have to prefix the command by `./`.
